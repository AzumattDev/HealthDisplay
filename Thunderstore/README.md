# Health Display

Shows the HP values and percentage of creatures and bosses.

- Note: The "health" isn't accurate to damage numbers due to how the game scales player damage. The health is just a
  baseline of how strong the creature might be, and it's recommended to use percent values.

## Client and Server Side

* Optionally install this on server for version check and ServerSync

## Customized HealthBar

* All configuration is made within the **Azumatt.HealthDisplay.cfg** and is live. Highly recommend using
  [Official BepInEx ConfigurationManager](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/Official_BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/)
* Change scale of enemy/tamed bar
* Change color of enemy bar/tamed bar
* Change color of percentage [Max, Mid, Low, Critical]
